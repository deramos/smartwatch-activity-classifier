# Smartwatch Activity Classifier
A mini project that stages, models, generates, and classifies Apple SmartWatch Data. We will use AWS S3, AWS EMR, 
Kafka, Apache Spark, and Databricks Datagen.

## Data Loading
The first stage of the application is to load bulk data (~160GB) from Washington State University (WSU)
Center of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems (CASAS) archives 
 [https://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/smartwatch/](https://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/smartwatch/) into
a staging folder in an S3 bucket. We use a Spark job on EMR to clean the data (remove null values) and save the processed
data into a `processed` folder on S3 and also into a glue table.

## Model Training
The cleaned up data is used to train a machine learning classifier that predicts the recorded activity. The spark 
script that performs this can be found here [Activity Classifier](activitymodule/spark/scripts/train-activity-classifier.py)
The trained model will be used to predict the activity of new generated samples streamed from a kafka topic using spark 
streaming later in the application. 

### Active Learning
To retrain the model with new samples, active learning technique is used. When new data samples are streamed from kafka 
topic, the activities on those samples are predicted using the model trained above. Misclassified samples are labeled with 
the correct class labels by a human annotator and saved to a feature store. Airflow routinely picks samples in the feature
store and retrains the model. If the new model has a better performance than the old one, it is saved and used to classify 
new streaming samples

## Kafka Streaming
To simulate the generation of new Apple Watch Data, we will use [Databricks Labs DataGen](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen)
and the descriptive statistics calculated from the cleaned data samples. This ensures that generated data maintains the 
distribution of the original dataset. 
The generated data is loaded into spark streaming and written into a kafka topic. The activity prediction pipeline above
picks up the data from the kafka topic and makes predictions. The samples with low predictions are sent to the annotation pipeline 
that will be used to retrain the model at a later date. Predictions are saved into a SQL database (like Redshift)

## TO RUN
To run, clone the project. Run the `init.sh` to fetch data from WSU and sync it to S3. The script also copies spark scripts 
from local directory to s3 bucket to be used later in EMR, and builds the project using `docker compose build`.

Run `rundatapreprocess.py` to submit an EMR job which creates a cluster (if it doesn't exist), and cleans up the watch 
data in S3. The cleaned data is saved into a `processed` folder on S3, and a Glue table that will later be migrated to 
a redshift table.

```
python activitymodule/jobs/run-data-preprocess.py
```
This job cleans up data from the staging directory on S3 and saves the result as parquet file on S3. It also saves a copy
to a glue table (and later redshift).

Run `train-activity-classifier.py` to  submit the EMR to train a machine learning classifier to predict watch activity 
using the cleaned data.

### Run the application
Start the project using `docker compose up`. The spark container runs the `start-jobs.sh` script which submits the
`predict-activity.py` and `generate-new-data.py` using spark-submit

```
/usr/lib/spark/bin/spark-submit /home/hadoop/spark/scripts/predict-activity.py
/usr/lib/spark/bin/spark-submit /home/hadoop/spark/scripts/generate-new-data.py
```
The `generate-new-data` script uses dblDataGen to generate new watch data that is of the same distribution as the previously
loaded watch data. This statistics of the data is loaded from glue or redshift. The newly generated data is sent into a 
kafka topic. 

The `predict-activity` script reads data from kafka topic and predicts the activity associated with the data.
The machine learning model trained above is loaded into the `predict-activity` notebook which also starts a spark 
streaming job. The spark stream takes data from `ticker-watch-data` kafka topic which is constantly loaded with data 
generated by the `generate-new-data` script above
